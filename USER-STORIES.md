User Stories:

As a person who spends a good amount of time on the internet and keeps up with trending things, I enjoy comparing funny gifs and seeing how other people adapted and personalized their own gifs.

As a user, I want fast and reactive interactivity on a webpage.

As a user, I want to keep track of what other people think as well, and if they share the same likings.
